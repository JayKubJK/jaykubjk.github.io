# Web Design Is My Passion Fruit
So I've decided to make this website mostly so I have a way to learn and apply web design, CSS/HTML, JS/TS stuff, etc
What would I put on here? No clue. Maybe this would be my main website for my socials, art I've commissioned, an about me, I haven't thought about it yet.
